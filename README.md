# gauge
*A collection of standardized testing data for audio feature extraction.*

## Motivation
This collection enables various implementations of [Meyda](https://github.com/meyda/meyda) (and other feature extraction toolkits) to run tests using a standardized set of signals and expected output. The aim is to ensure that projects like [meyda-rs](https://github.com/meyda/meyda-rs) can be used interchangeably with Meyda.

The collection could be used as a submodule or a npm module.
